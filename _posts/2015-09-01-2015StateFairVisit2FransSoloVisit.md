Quick trip over to the Fair at lunch today, this time solo.  Had too many foods I still wanted to try!  Finally got to the Farmer's Union for breakfast, and it was amazing.  Also caught Hot Indian Foods on their last day at the Fair (the Midtown Global Market booth changes to The Rabbit Hole tomorrow), and spent some quality time in the Agriculture Bldg.  Pictures have been added to our Fair album for those following along!
