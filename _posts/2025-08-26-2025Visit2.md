Dana and I headed back to the Fair one more time on Tuesday before she had to head home.  The weather was Fair perfection, especially in the morning, when it was overcast and breezy. We hit the Fair hard, covering a ton of ground in our 7.5 hours there. Here are the highlights!

Since the apple flavor of the Patisserie Sweets at Farmers Union were sold out on Day 1 by the time we got there, we decided to head there first thing, so we got off the bus and made a beeline for the other side of the Fair. Which brought us right past the corn stand, so when in Rome...

We finished our walk to the Farmers Union munching on some really excellent roasted corn. I'd give this one a 9.5/10!

We got in the already-growing lines at Farmers Union and picked up the Patisserie Sweet (and I got a nitro cold press, of course).

Surprisingly given the Patisserie 46 pedigree here, this was just alright. The pastry was a little dry around the outside. The inside and apple filling was really good, though. Let's call it a B.

After that, we lingered near the Ag building until it opened at 9am to try to beat the rush to see the seed art. It sorta worked - about 200 other people had the same idea, so we waited about 20 minutes to get in, but I bet that was still the shortest line of the day. And while in line, I popped over to the apple stand to get a glass of fresh apple cider, which was delightful!

This year's seed art had 451 entries, which is roughly double what it was two years ago. I think we've hit peak seed art! I can't possibly summarize all the great seed art we saw this year in this post, so I'll do a separate post on that. Here's just a preview:

I think Katie needs to go introduce herself to Megan and bond over their shared love for Back to the Future! After seed art, we made our way through the vegetable contest, which was closed for judging on our last visit. Look at the wee peppers!

This year's giant pumpkin weighed more than 1,500 pounds!

Done with Ag, we headed back outside and made a quick detour to Dino's to try the Athena's Whipped Feta. There was controversy within the Fabrizio household on whether this item would be good.

Well, folks, it's our first new food home run of 2025! The shugg sauce on top provided just enough spice to cut through the creaminess of the feta, and the pita crisps were perfect - crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and still warm. There's nothing about this I would do differently!

Dana wanted to get some merch so we hit up the FairWear store. Dana got a coffee mug and hat for herself. As per usual, I bought more Fair stuff I don't need! I scored a couple of nice Fair tee shirts and a hat on sale, and some socks for Henry's crazy sock collection.

From there we headed over to Creative Activities, one of my favorite spots in the Fair. We spend most of our time looking at the food competition categories.

The cookie decorating theme this year was Back to School. I liked this set a lot!

While we were there, Del Sur was doing a demonstration on how they make their empanadas. Sadly, we didn't stick around long enough to get the samples.

Continuing our journey north, the next stop was the Education Building. I wanted to see what amazing art the school kids came up with this year. They did not disappoint!! Here are some of my favorites...

8th grade, scratch art.

I will never stop being amazed at the talented kids we have in our state!

By now we were getting hungry again, so when we made a stop at CinneSmith's for some cinnamon buns.

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit2/cinnasmiths.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit2/cinnasmiths.jpg)

It's been several years since I've had these, and I forgot how freakin' good these are! This was one of those moments where the stars aligned and provided the perfect food at the perfect moment. Boom - a classic food home run to complement our new food home run. Dana declared this to be "like heaven in my mouth"! We're on a roll today with the food!

Up at the North End, the Urban Glow Mocktails booth has replaced Brim, and it's an upgrade. We tried their Peach No Fashioned mocktail and their Cheweenies.

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit2/urbanglow.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit2/urbanglow.jpg)

The mocktail was decent, although I thought it was a little too one-noted, I would have liked it to have a bit more bite to it. It was fine, and refreshing. The real winner here are the Cheweenies. Two mini Kzarmarczuk's hot dogs speared through the middle of a Hawaiian sweet roll with homemade mustards on top. We opted for the peach and pineapple mustards. The pineapple was really good, but the peach mustard was another home run. Would definitely get these again!

After more good luck shopping at the Good Things tent (I got the Happy Place tee shirt pictured above that I missed out on last year!) we started to head back down south. Along the way, we visited Baba's (head's up, new location on the other side of the street now!) for a hummus bowl. This was more for Dana to try since she's never had Baba's, so we opted for the classic bowl.

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit2/babas.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit2/babas.jpg)

I had talked up the pita bites here a lot, so I was eager to see what Dana thought. She liked them but pointed out that it's basically fried dough more than a pita. I'm ok with that! She gave the overall bowl high marks.

As we passed the Food Bldg we popped in for some Mouth Trap cheese curds. These, along with the Perfect Pickles, are the two things where you know they will be perfect every single time without fail. 

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit2/curds.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit2/curds.jpg)

They were perfect, warm and squeaky!

This was the last day for the Somali Street Fries, so we went into the International Bazaar to check them out. The line was long, but we got in it anyway. Or at least we thought we did, until someone pointed out that this was just a break in the line to let traffic through and the end of the line was actually wayyyyyyyy back further. Seriously, there were at least 300 people in line! It went all the way through the merch area and out the other side. Sorry folks, there is NO FOOD at the Fair worth waiting that long for. It puzzles me that people do this every year (cough I'm looking at you Peachy's cough). Folks, the Fair is jammed packed with wonderful food, don't waste hours in lines like this! Suffice to say, no Somali Street Fries were had.

By now the crowd was growing, but I wanted to make sure that Dana got to see the butter princess sculptures since she didn't see that on her last visit to the Fair many years ago. I put my Fair knowledge on display as we snuck around to the Dairy Bldg's "secret" rear entrance, beating the Dairy Bldg crowds and emerging directly at the butter sculptures. We arrived at a great time, towards the end of the lunch break, so we were there when the scultor and princess returned for the afternoon carving session. Here's a behind the scenes look at Princess Kay of the Milky Way finalist Monica Evers of Wabasha County getting ready to go back into the chamber.

We overheard her saying that it was 40 degrees in there so not too bad, really just fingers and toes that get cold. The whole process will take 6-8 hours, but she noted that hers may take a little longer since she has glasses. The dairy princess program is designed to highlight young women in the dairy industry, and Princess Kay spends her year as a goodwill ambassador for the MN dairy industry.

With butter sculptures checked off, Dana had been wanting to try poutine since our earlier day at the Fair, so we stopped at Duke's. The timing wasn't great, since these are topped with more curds and we just did Mouth Trap, but you know what, sometimes you just have to push through and persevere.

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit2/poutine.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit2/poutine.jpg)

She gave it a thumb's up!

After all those curds we needed a palette cleanser. We wandered through the DNR Bldg. and after a brief stop at the fish pond made our way over to Quench'd for the sorbet and the lemonade float.

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit2/quenchd.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit2/quenchd.jpg)

Both were great, but I prefer the simplicity of the sorbet. It's easier to appreciate the freshness and the lemon rind. It's seriously good!

We were ready for a break, and we also needed to linger around the grandstand area until 3pm when more Star Tribune lip balm would be available, so we settled into the Dan Patch concert stage having no idea what the show was. Today was Military Appreciation Day so they were featuring military bands, and we had the good fortune to be there for the Boots 'N Brass brass band.

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit2/brassband.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit2/brassband.jpg)

They were a lot of fun, doing brass adaptations of popular songs.

At 3pm we got our lip balms - Norway Pine this year, I give it a B+ - and we were wearing out. We still had a couple of items to check off the list though (again, you push through and persevere...)

On my agenda was the Royal Raspberry Sour Soft Serve Beer at Prye's (next to LuLu's). The buzz has been real all Fair long, so I had to see for myself. I got in the Cone Only line, which I can conclusively say moved slower than the regular line. Nevertheless, I eventually emerged with a cone.

_This is not ice cream_
[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit2/softservebeer.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit2/softservebeer.jpg)

This was... incredible. I have no idea how they managed to do this, but it's straight up beer in soft serve form. It tastes like beer, it bites like beer, it is not like ice cream at all. I don't even like fruit beers, and I really appreciated this simply for the science of it. Can you imagine if they figure out how to do this with mini donut beer? I'll never leave the Fairgrounds.

With that new food success on the books, it was time to head out. Dana's last agenda item was more pickles. She'd been dreaming about them since the first visit.

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit2/pickles.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit2/pickles.jpg)

They were perfect, of course. I swung by Tiny Tim's to get a treat for Sally back at the house.

Then it was time to call it a day. Phew! That's a wrap for Dana's visit to the Fair.

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit2/onlyinmn.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit2/onlyinmn.jpg)

There's nothing more satisfying than playing Fair host to an out-of-towner and watching the whole process of the Fair experience unfold for them. After a while, you get a sense for whether they "get it" or not, and Dana definitely gets the Fair. Good times! Who will be our next out-of-town visitor?? It could be YOU!

Katie and I will be back on Friday for visit #3. This is shaping up to be kinda a weird Fair year. It doesn't look like I'll get my solo trip in this year, and I'm also not sure if we'll be back again, so it may be a three-visit year. It's been a long time since I've only gone three days! Katie and I will try to cover a lot of ground tomorrow, just in case that turns out to be our last visit. Till then, happy Fairing everyone!
