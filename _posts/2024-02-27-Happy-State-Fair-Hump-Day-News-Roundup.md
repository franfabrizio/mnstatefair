**HAPPY STATE FAIR HUMP DAY!**

February 27th is State Fair Hump Day! We're now closer to the 2024 fair than we are to the 2023 fair!

To celebrate, here's a news roundup of recent fair news.

# Grandstand Concert Schedule is Filling In!

So far we've got four Grandstand concerts announced: Motley Crue, Kidz Bop, the Happy Together Tour ('60s and '70s pop), and comedian Nate Bargatze. Full details at [the State Fair's Grandstand page](https://www.mnstatefair.org/grandstand/). None of those are must-sees for us (though Kidz Bop would have been a couple of years ago), but if any of these are your jam, get your tickets!

# Find Anything Good at the State Fair Auction?

The Fair auctioned off a whole lot of old memorabilia this month. The auction [closed this week](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2024/02/27/minnesota-state-fair-auction-closed-tuesday-some-items-sold-for-thousands).

# Ticket Prices Hold Steady

For the first time in six years, there's not a ticket price increase. A full price ticket will still be $18 at the gate this year. But why wait when you can get [$15 tickets in advance](https://www.etix.com/ticket/p/89467345/2024-gate-admission-ticket?partner_id=4584) right now!

# Modest 2024 Fairgrounds Updates

The same news release announcing the ticket prices also had a [list of the facilities work they plan to do](https://www.kare11.com/article/entertainment/events/minnesota-state-fair/2024-minnesota-state-fair-ticket-prices-admission/89-0c800e00-500b-4607-beca-187b5595df68) before this year's fair. The list is pretty modest and the Fairgrounds will look pretty much the same as it did last year. The ones I'm most excited about are the additional water fill stations! I'm always hunting for those.

That's it for now. Expect more Grandstand concert announcements soon.
