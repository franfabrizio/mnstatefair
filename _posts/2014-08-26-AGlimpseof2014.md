Trip number two to this year's MN State Fair is in the books.  Tonight's food tally: prime rib taco, Korean BBQ shoulder, chicken in a waffle, pronto pup, Turkey-to-Go sandwich, root beer, blueberry lemonade, beer, soda, deep fried pickles, gelato, and an ice cream waffle sandwich.  Katie Richards Fabrizio and I hit the Fair hard tonight!  Trip number three (the Henry trip) is this weekend.
