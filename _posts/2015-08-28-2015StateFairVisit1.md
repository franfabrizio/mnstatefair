First visit to the fair is in the books.  Food tally: Turkey to Go (w/ chopped bacon and sweet glaze this time, was good), roasted corn, mini donut beer, Kiwanis malt, pronto pup, Mancini's margherita pizza, West End Creamery ice cream waffle sandwich, cheese curds, and some Sausage by Cynthia jerky for the road.  I'd do everything again except maybe the malt.  The mini donut beer was the favorite, even Katie liked it.  Sounds gimmicky, but I'd drink that not just at the fair.  It does this crazy thing where a wave of malty sweetness hits you way after you sipped it.  Also got in some Charlie Parr (famed Minnesota folk music), some house band funk music, a trip through the craft galleries, and some shopping.  Back on Sunday for all the kid (and breakfast) fun!  Food pics coming!
