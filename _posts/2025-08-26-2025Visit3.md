Friday was date day for us at the Fair! Katie and I got Henry off to high school and then we headed out for a day of fun and food.

Continuing this year's trend of pork for breakfast at the Fair, our first stop was at RC's BBQ to try their new Hula Kalua pork.

Right away I was happy that they were less stingy with the portion size this year (see my complaints last year). This is Hawaiian-style smoked pork collar with sides of pickles and banana chips. The pork itself was tasty and tender. Katie thought it was a pretty standard BBQ flavor, but I thought I detected a hint of pineapple in the sauce. The pickles were a nice touch. Where the dish fell a little flat were the banana chips - texturally all wrong and didn't really add to the dish at all. This would have been great with a side of Hawaiian mac salad. Overall, a solid new food that needed just a bit of tweaking.

Next up was a really fun event for this public radio dork! It was MPR Day at the fair, and on the Dan Patch stage Tom Crann (local MPR host) was interviewing David Brancaccio of NPR's Marketplace Morning Report.

They talked about the behind the scenes of making the Morning Report, and one thing that was fascinating is that David is based in Los Angeles, which means his work day starts at 2:15am. Oof!

It was about 10:30am, and although this was way too early to do this, due to where we were on the Fairgrounds it was time to tackle something I had been dreading all Fair but knew I had to do for science... the Uncrustaburger at Coaster's. I'll let the description speak for itself: "A 4 oz. hamburger patty with cheese, pickles and special sauce, sandwiched between two deep-fried peanut butter & grape jelly UncrustablesÂ®."

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/sandwich.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/sandwich.jpg)

This was easily the worst abomination among the new foods, but I know the masses are demanding that I try this, so here we are. Things did not start out well visually - the burger looked entirely uninspiring, and zero attempt was made to melt the cheese. It definitely didn't get better when I picked up the thing and I literally saw the oil oozing out of the fried uncrustables. For some reason, I kept moving this beast towards my mouth anyway...

Ok. Here's the thing. Somehow, despite the utter lack of culinary competence in preparing this dish, it was... not awful. In fact, I hate to admit this, but I kinda... liked it?? I was pretty mad about that, because I really, really wanted this to be just awful. I can't explain it, but the flavors sorta all worked together, and bafflingly, mixing PB&J, beef, and lettuce and tomato sorta made for an interesting textural experience?!? Katie tried it and went a little further, stating that she was digging it!

For sure, the sandwich had its problems. For one thing, it was structurally a disaster. I'm not posting the picture, but the aftermath was... not pretty, either on the plate or on our faces. Napkin count was north of 20. And they definitely need to get their frying game dialed in and do these things at the right temperature. But, I can see a future where, with a little more intention about the burger and its prep, and some frying conditions that the health department would approve of, this could be a thing?? I don't expect either of those things to come from Coaster's, an establishment far more known for its (generally crappy) beer than its food, but it's no longer as unfathomable as it was when this food was first announced, which I'm taking as a win here.

Ok, time to shift gears and visit a vendor we'd definitely been looking forward to checking out. Greater Tater is a new vendor this year, and they have a great backstory, as it is run by an inspirational young man named David Kaetterhenry and his childhood friend Chaz Lacy. David has Down syndrome and has long had a passion for food service. He started with a food truck that has been gaining fame across the metro, and then they scored the coveted MN State Fair spot. Their slogan is "It's what's on the inside that counts".

We were thrilled to see one of the longer lines of the day lined up at their booth! David wasn't working when we visited, unfortunately, but we were still excited to try the tater kegs. We opted for the bacon and cheddar stuffed kegs. They come with a choice of dipping sauces (we picked Top the Tater, of course), and they were yummy! They had other flavors like jalapeno, cheese bomb, and breakfast skillet, so if we make it back again this year we'll try more.

Having just eaten bacon, we thought it'd be a good idea to visit the pig barn. On our way over there we had a quintessential wander-into-a-strange-and-wondrous-activity Fair experience - the Yogurt Eating Contest!

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/yogurt.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/yogurt.jpg)

This was...something! I don't think these people woke up thinking they were going to be in a yogurt eating contest, so it was definitely not a professional field of contestants! The winner was the older gentleman in the hat, who ate a tub of strawberry yogurt followed by around half a tub of chocolate yogurt in three minutes. Several of the contestants were looking a lot worse for wear afterwards; I hope they recovered enough to enjoy the rest of their fair visit!

With that display of gluttony over, we went onwards to the pig barn. It was changeover day (when the 4-H and FFA kids swap out in the barns) so there was lots of animal moving activity.

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/pig.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/pig.jpg)

The Fair is the only place where it is socially acceptable, dare I say almost expected, that otherwise respectable adults can wander around with animal ear hats and not warrant even a second glance.

Back outside, we tried another new vendor, Beans & Beignets. They have a variety of coffee drinks, and as you might guess, beignets. I opted for the Bee Stinger (cold press, whipped honey, cream, and cayenne pepper) and Katie got iced tea.

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/drinks.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/drinks.jpg)

We also got some beignets.

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/beignet.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/beignet.jpg)

First, the drinks. It's not every day I want cayenne pepper in my coffee (or any day, really) but we're at the Fair, so why not. It was pretty interesting, not overpowering, but definitely a bit "shocking". The cold press itself was definitely serviceable, and the whipped honey was really cool, I liked it overall. Katie's iced tea was unfortunately really subpar - we suspect they took hot tea and iced it down, as it was super watery and weak. The preponderance of bad iced tea at the Fair continues!

As for the beignets, split decision here. I thought they were pretty good. Definitely on the larger end for beignets, and almost too pillowy - they had big empty bubbles of space inside. But taste-wise, I thought they were on point. Katie was less impressed and thought they were not that authentic. One thing we agree on - they're expensive. $3 per beignet (at least when you get just two).

Katie was ready to take a food break and hit the Creative Activities Building. I detoured for a mini donut beer on the way there. Hello again old friend...

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/beer.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/beer.jpg)

One category I have overlooked in past years is the art-on-a-stick competition. They announce a theme and then you make a mini quilt mounted on a paint mixing stick. This year's theme appeared to be Fair foods.

I definitely identify with this one.

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/stickart.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/stickart.jpg)

The Perioding Table of Minnesota State Fair Foods on a Stick was especially inspired.

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/periodic.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/periodic.jpg)

Another pass through the food competitions. I overlooked the cupcakes on my last visit. The theme was bugs, which is maybe not the most appetizing choice here. But, we both liked the lifecycle of the monarch...

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/bugslife.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/bugslife.jpg)

I want to take a little detour now and talk to our Swifties for a second. There was this little nugget in the CA building...

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/taylor.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/taylor.jpg)

... which followed this entry in the seed art...

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/taylorseed.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/taylorseed.jpg)

I know that art is in the eye of the beholder, and that both of these items took a lot of work, and I never want to disparage anyone who loves the Fair enough to submit their work. But this beholder is a little frightened. Are you ok, Swifties?

Ok, moving on... how cute are these tiny clothes?!?

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/clothes.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/clothes.jpg)

After our spin through CA we were ready for some music. We settled in to hear Tonic Sol-Fa at the Bandshell. They are an MSP-based acapella group and it turns out this is their 30th year playing the Fair, and they are on their farewell tour.

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/tonic.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/tonic.jpg)

We lasted three songs. They are undeniably talented, but I'll just come out and say it - we find acapella hard to listen to. Katie described it as "unsettling - I can't relax". I agree. They definitely had a ton of fans though, the place was packed. So, I'm happy for them!

The one building I had not visited yet was the Fine Arts building, so we headed there next. Somehow, I was hungry, so I stopped for a Pronto Pup out front.

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/pronto.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/pronto.jpg)

I like Pancho Dogs better, but this was the convenient option, so I got the ole Banquet on a Stick. I regret it - just not as good. And this was not even a good Pronto Pup, maybe the fry oil was ready for a change?

As for the art, it was a bit of a quiet year for me in the Fine Arts building, but that's not to say there weren't any standouts. Here were a few of the pieces I liked best.

Back outside, we were just in time for the parade. Everybody love a parade! Especially when Fairchild is there.

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/fairchild.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/fairchild.jpg)

Parades are weird.

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/artcar.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/artcar.jpg)

Really weird.

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/giantcow.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/giantcow.jpg)

After the parade we wandered the North End, eventually making our way over to the street food area. This is where Baba's and Scenic 61 have their food trucks set up, alongside Summer Lakes mocktails. We always opt for Baba's so this year I wanted to mix it up and head over to Scenic 61 for their Bahn Mi croissant.

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/bahnmi.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/banhmi.jpg)

This is about as close as you get to "fancy food" at the Fair. Pork confit, chicken pÃ¢tÃ©, cucumber, pickled vegetables, sriracha aioli, and cilantro on a legit croissant. It was really good! My only ask would be for a bit more topping to even out the pork and chicken, but I'm not going to complain too much that they were generous with the meat. I also appreciate that they served this with chips. That made it feel more like a complete meal. Scenic 61 is more known for their lobster rolls. You know how I feel about seafood at the Fair if you've been reading this blog for a while, but if I was going to try it anywhere, I would trust them to get it right. Maybe next year!

Katie had had her eye on a particular dessert over the years that we've never quite been able to fit it - the key lime pie on a stick from the kiosk over by the food bldg and Skyride station. We made sure to put it on our agenda for this year.

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/keylime.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/keylime.jpg)

This was really good! Nice and cold and refreshing, plenty of lime-y-ness, real crust on the inside too. Highly recommend, will do again!

Of course, when you find yourself by the Food building, you Mouth Trap.

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/curds.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/curds.jpg)

Perfect. As usual.

We were fooded out, so we settled in to the International Bazaar stage for some more music, this time from Tyte Phitt, a funk party band.

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/tyte.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/tyte.jpg)

They were super fun! Lots of great funk songs as well as some pop like Michael Jackson and even one rock song (Jump - Van Halen) which they managed to pull off quite well. They were high energy and engaging, and we stayed through their whole set.

We were starting to wear out, so we wandered towards the exit. Along the way, we came across the Minnesota Territorial Pioneers' Log Cabin. Katie had never been inside so we checked it out. The MTP is a group dedicated to preserving the memory of the early Minnesota territorial pioneers through artifacts and education. They've been involved with the Fair since 1860! They have a great display of artifacts, including a replica of an old general store, a schoolhouse, and a typical homestead. It's a nice quiet place to take a break from the Fair, too.

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/pioneer.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/pioneer.jpg)

We had one last food item to cross off our list before leaving, and it's a classic.

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/corn.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/corn.jpg)

Once again delicious. They're really having a banner year with the corn! We washed it down with a Lift Bridge Mini Donut Cream Soda from the root beer barrel folks.

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/minidonutsoda.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/minidonutsoda.jpg)

And so our date day at the Fair concluded! Eight hours of food, music, education and fun.

With the Fair in its final weekend, we may or may not get back for one more visit. If we do, great! If not, I feel like we've covered it pretty well this year. We'll see what happens over the next couple of days! In the meantime, I'm also working on a seed art deep dive post which I'll get posted ASAP. Happy Fairgoing!
