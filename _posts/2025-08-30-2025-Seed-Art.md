This year there were 451 entries into the seed art competition - twice as many as just two years ago. Clearly, seed art is having a moment, so I thought I would do a dedicated post on the topic this year. Here are some of my favorites this year, grouped by theme.
(FYI - there are two main types of seed art - natural colors, and painted/dyed. I'm not differentiating them here.)

First up is what I would call "classical" seed art - these often feature nature scenes, local landmarks, or everyday items.

A tip of the cap to one of the U's colleges.

A couple of representations of one of Minnesota's most famous landmarks.

Some nature scenes.

I especially like the way the goat's ears spills over the frame.

And this one gets points for being super specific. This is illustrating a scientific principle known as [evolutionary anachronism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_anachronism).

And a couple of really cool everyday items.

Next are pieces playing off of other famous works of art, often with a Fair or Minnesota twist.

The [Girl with a Pearl Earring](https://www.mauritshuis.nl/en/our-collection/artworks/670-girl-with-a-pearl-earring) is apparently a fair fan!

The _Squirrel_ with a Pearl Earring...

A Minnesota play on the beloved children's book [Goodnight Moon](https://www.amazon.com/Goodnight-Moon-Margaret-Wise-Brown/dp/0694003611). (Charles Schulz, creator of Peanuts, is from Minnesota, if you didn't know.)

Not one...

...but two remixes of [Ren√© Magritte's Son of Man](http://renemagritte.org/the-son-of-man.jsp).

Magritte was popular, here's a play on his [Treachery of Images](https://www.renemagritte.org/the-treachery-of-images.jsp)...

Of course you have the straight-up Fair-themed pieces too.

Corn dog tragedy!

Wait, is the fair on fire? Or is it just sunset? The snacks look distressed.

This is a play on the [We Believe yard sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Believe_(yard_sign)).

Then we have the references to pop culture.

An homage to our local women's pro sports teams.

And finally, you can always count on a meme or two to show up in the crop art.

And then you have probably the biggest growth area in the last few years, political seed art, definitely leaning to the left.

This gets straight to the point.

But is it a Pronto Pup or Pancho Dog??

Some folks are a little mad at Canada for the smoky summer days around here...

Finally, there's the "in a category all their own" category...

Shoutout to aphasia! I loved this one because Katie did her dissertation on aphasia. So random!

And this one just made me laugh. We all have days like this, don't we? We're not all refined enough to deal with them by making beautiful seed art, though. Way to go, Nia!
[![image](/assets/2025/2025-Seed-Art/thissucks.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025-Seed-Art/thissucks.jpg)

This might have been the best year for seed art yet. If it gets any more popular, they're going to need a bigger venue!

Which one was your favorite?
