It's that time again... The Minnesota State Fair starts tomorrow! We're doing something a little different this year - we're camping AT the Fair for the first two days. We got a spot in the campground lottery and I'm writing from our camper on the Fairgrounds right now! So we'll be using this as home base for two epic days at the Fair this week! If any friends or family are coming tomorrow or Friday let us know!
