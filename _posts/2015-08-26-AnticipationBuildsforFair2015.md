The Minnesota State Fair starts tomorrow!  In a tremendous display of restraint, Katie Richards Fabrizio and I will not be making our first visit until Friday.  And then again Sunday.  And then again Thursday next week.  Leaving open the possibility for a final visit next weekend or Labor Day, just in case.  We _may_ be obsessed.
