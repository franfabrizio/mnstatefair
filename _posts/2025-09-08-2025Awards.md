After taking a week to let the Fair memories marinate, I present to you the 8th Annual Fran's Fair Awards! All the hits, misses and surprises of the 2025 Fair in one place! Let's just jump right in.

## Food Categories

As is our tradition here at Fran's Fair Awards, the bad news always comes first.

### Biggest Disappointment

This one really hurts this year. The always-on-point Farmers Union paired up with the internationally-recognized Patisserie 46. There's no way this collab could miss, right?

Unfortunately, their **_Apple Patisserie Sweet_** ended up being very pedestrian.

The topping of Honeycrisp apples and pecan streusel was good, but I didn't really detect any orange blossom maple glaze and the pastry was baked dry on the edges. It certainly wasn't bad, but given the pedigree at work here, it definitely was a big letdown.

#### Dishonorable Mentions

There were of course a few more disappointments, including:

* **Gass Station's Smashadilla** - First of all, it was a smashataco, and for the price, there was not enough there. The burger was average and the toppings uninspired.
* **Beans & Beignet's Iced Tea** - More like tea-tinged water.
* **Magdalena's Rotisserie Pastry** - I had such high hopes for this, but the pastry was completely overshadowed by the massive amount of fine-but-nothing-special soft serve ice cream.
* **Pronto Pup** - Really subpar this year. I think the fry oil was off.
* **Peterson's Pork Chop** - The pork chop was the very first Fair item we ate this year, and I think we jumped the gun. They were still in their first hour, and I don't think they had the operation dialed in yet. It was good, but it's usually phenomenal.

### Best Main Entree

This year's winner for best main entree is:

**_Scenic 61's Bahn Mi Croissant_**

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/bahnmi.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/banhmi.jpg)

Katie and I both loved this off-the-beaten-path item. Scenic 61 is known more for their lobster rolls, which again - seafood at the Fair. But when I noticed they were also offering a bahn mi, I was intrigued. Loved this - the combo of chicken pate and pork confit gave a big umami punch while the pile of fresh herbs and veggies freshened up the entire sandwich. The croissant was legit too, and chips on the side made it feel like a meal. Confit and pate at the Fair? Yep, and it's a winner!

### Best Snack

This is probably the easiest category of the year. There's an obvious winner here, and it's the:

**_Athena's Whipped Feta at Dino's_**

Holy cow that's about the closest to perfection that I've ever experienced in terms of pita chips! Crispy on the outside, soft and warm on the inside. The creamy feta and the tingle of the shugg were the perfect complement to each other. This one punched wayyyy above its weight and was a really fun surprise!

### Best Dessert

I know I keep featuring this item year after year, but really, it's that good. What I love about this year's winner is its simplicity, it's perfect just the way it is, no fuss. This year's winner is:

**_Lemonade Sorbet at Quench'd_**

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit2/quenchd.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit2/quenchd.jpg)

It's the perfect palate cleanser, and the fresh lemons shine on this. I could eat this every visit to the fair, truthfully.

### Best Breakfast

I really only had one proper breakfast at the Fair this year, but it was a great one. The award goes to:

**_Al's Blueberry Pancakes at the Hamline Church Dining Hall_**

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit4/als.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit4/als.jpg)

Now here's a power couple collab that really works! There's nothing fancy here, just Al's Diner's famous-for-a-reason blueberry pancakes and a host of traditional breakfast sides, served up by cheery church volunteers and enjoyed at communal tables while talking with fellow Fair lovers. It's a blast from the past and I hope it never changes!

### Best Drink

Is this year's winner a drink? I don't know, but I'm giving the award to:

**_Soft Serve Beer at Prye's/LuLu's_**

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit2/softservebeer.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit2/softservebeer.jpg)

Two weeks later and I'm still baffled about how they pulled this off. Looks like ice cream, feels like ice cream, melts back into beer once it hits your mouth. It's hard to shock me with unusual food at this point in my Fair career, but this one did it. As a scientist I love the process behind this. As a Fair afficianado, I think this is a perfect Fair item - familiar drink presented in an extremely novel way. I don't even love fruit beer, but I have to give the award just because of the novelty and the execution.

### Best Food Value

There's almost no food at the Fair that you can truly label as a good value, but some items still stand out for not completely emptying your wallet! This year's winner is:

**_Cider from the apple stand in the Ag Building_**

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit2/cider.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit2/cider.jpg)

This stand actually boasts multiple good values (see: cider freeze pop), but this year I opted for the cider. Really cold, really fresh, really good apples. Not much else to say, but at $4 it's an affordable and delicious way to taste the literal fruits of Minnesota's agriculture, which is kinda what the Fair is all about!

### Most Unusual Thing I Ate

There's no suspense with this one, so let's just come right out and give the award to: 

**_Uncrustaburger at Coaster's_**

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/sandwich.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/sandwich.jpg)

Just the fact that this wasn't awful is worthy of an award. It's like they held a contest for someone to think up the most horrific sandwich they could, and then they dared themselves to make it edible! Even more impressive is that this thing was kinda a'ight even though Coaster's completely fumbled the execution of it! Imagine if they actually fried the uncrustables competently, or elevated the burger itself? This thing could be... dare I say it? ...good?

### Biggest Regret Of Food I Didn't Get To This Year

New foods in the International Bazaar are increasingly becoming known for ridiculous lines, and this year it was so bad that I never did get to try the:

**_Somali Street Fries at Oasis_**

They were the darling new food of the Fair, but no food is worth a 200+ person line. The silver lining is that word on the street is that Oasis is going to start serving these in their restaurant, so I still have shot at these after all.

### Comeback Kid

The classics really shined this year! This award could go to a number of contestants, including the curds, the corn, and last year's winner, the deep fried pickles, but one stood above the rest. The award goes to:

**_Cinnamon Buns at CinneSmith's_**

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit2/cinnasmiths.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit2/cinnasmiths.jpg)

You know how every once in a blue moon, you have the perfect food at the perfect time in the perfect place? This. Wow, the CinneSmith's cinnamon buns slapped this year! Dana described them as "like a bite of heaven in your mouth". I don't think I could do a better job describing these. They often don't make the cut because of their unfortunate location at the far north end, but honestly, they are kinda reason enough to park in the north parking lot and rearrange your whole itinerary for the day!

### Best New Food That Didn't Win Another Category

This isn't a new food, but it's new to us, and it's a shame it took us so long to discover it. We really enjoyed the:

**_Key Lime Pie on a Stick at the Key Lime Pie Bar_**

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/keylime.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/keylime.jpg)

I'm glad Katie made me try this, it turns out that chocolate covered frozen key lime pie is pretty good! I especially liked the crust, too.

### Most Controversial Item

There weren't too many split decisions this year, but one that stands out is:

**_Beignets at Beans & Beignets_**

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/beignet.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/beignet.jpg)

Katie was not feelin' these at all. She didn't like their size (too big) or their texture (too airy). I thought they were fine, and might be even more charitable if they weren't $3 per beignet. To be fair, Katie was already walloped with some extremely disappointing iced tea from this vendor just before she tried the beignet, so it had two strikes against it right off the bat.

## Non-Food Categories

### Best Music

As per usual, most of the music comes on our date day visit. This year, Katie and I caught a few different concerts, and the clear winner was:

**_Tyte Phitt_**

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/tyte.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit3/tyte.jpg)

We caught this funk party band towards the end of a long day and it was just the pick-me-up we needed. High energy, fun, great songs that everyone knows - they put on a great show and know how to entertain the audience. I hope I get to see them again someday!

### Best Non-Musical Entertainment

Let's give the nod to:

**_Behind the scenes at the Butter Carving_**

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit2/butterprep.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit2/butterprep.jpg)

Not really entertainment, but it was fun and fascinating to get a little behind the scenes peek at the butter carving process.

### Best Art or Craft

The award goes to:

**_The Seed Art Explosion_**

[![image](/assets/2025/2025-Seed-Art/chocolates.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025-Seed-Art/chocolates.jpg)

I think the explosive growth of the seed art, doubling in size in just two years, deserves some recognition. Although the lines are getting almost unbearably long, the talent and quality keeps getting better.

### Best Educational Exhibit

You know what? I didn't really do any educational exhibits this year. And that's ok!

### Best Shopping

I actually had really good shopping luck at the official FairWear store, scoring a hat, a tee shirt, and socks for Henry.

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit2/swag.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit2/swag.jpg)

They have a great selection of stuff for being such a small store - tee shirts, hats, stickers, socks, puzzles, and more!

### Biggest Regret of Activity I Didn't Get to Do

I actually felt like I covered the Fair pretty well this year, but one thing I didn't catch any of was the Amateur Talent Contest, which is always fun. I'll make that more of a priority next year!

## Grand Champion Prize for Best of the Fair

Ok, the moment has finally arrived. We have crowned our category champions, but there can be only one Grand Champion! 

The 2025 Fran's Fair Awards Grand Champion Prize goes to..... *drumroll* ...

**_DANA VISITING FROM OUT OF TOWN TO GO TO THE FAIR!_**!

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit2/onlyinmn.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit2/onlyinmn.jpg)

After more than a decade since her last and only other visit, Dana came into town to visit the Fair this year. And she went strong, spending two full days at the Fair! Katie and I often say that people either get it or don't get it when it comes to the Fair, and Dana definitely gets it! She appreciated all the food experiments, the arts and crafts and cooking competition, and getting up close with the big animals, and fully embraced the Fair mentality - she was up and ready to go early, willing to eat whatever when the opportunity presented itself, and tried lots of new things - the perfect Fair visitor!

Congrats to Dana! We always have fun hosting out of town visitors, so maybe one of you out there could be our next Grand Champion...

And with that we've reached the end of our 2025 MN State Fair experience! I hope you enjoyed another year of me blogging the Fair. Have a great fall, everyone!
