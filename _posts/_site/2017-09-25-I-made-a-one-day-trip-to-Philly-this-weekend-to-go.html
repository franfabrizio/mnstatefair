<p>I made a one day trip to Philly this weekend to go to my aunt and uncle’s surprise 50th wedding anniversary party. (Great party! Someone send me a picture of me there! :) Of course I made sure to get one of these. Whiz wit, little ketchup and sweet peppers. Just the roll alone… Wish I could get a roll like that here. Does Aversa’s need a Minnesota bakery?</p>
