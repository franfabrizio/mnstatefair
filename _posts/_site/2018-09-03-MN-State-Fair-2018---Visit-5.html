<p>At last, we’ve reached journey’s end. Our last visit to the 2018 Minnesota State Fair, always bittersweet.</p>

<p>After the parade, we snuck inside the Creative Activities Building. Henry went right for these award-winning hand-crafted wooden toys.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/40875995_10217910468139042_3379842161884266496_n_10217910468099041.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/40875995_10217910468139042_3379842161884266496_n_10217910468099041.jpg" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>I take a photo of the jam wall every year I just love all the colors.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/40778897_10217910468699056_506970406247202816_n_10217910468619054.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/40778897_10217910468699056_506970406247202816_n_10217910468619054.jpg" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>The visit was coming to an end, but we first had to trek across the Fairgrounds because Katie had one last new food item to cross off her list. The mangonada shave ice from Minnesnowii Shave Ice in the West End. Mango-flavored shave ice with Mexican chamoy sauce (?), tajin chili powder and topped with mango boba pearls. Served with a tamarind candy straw. This was delicious! The pearls were especially fun. Katie reported that the straw was a little too intense for eating, but apparently you can!</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/40607188_10217910470019089_8442571218942427136_n_10217910469939087.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/40607188_10217910470019089_8442571218942427136_n_10217910469939087.jpg" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>And Sally got one last bag of mini donuts as we made our way to the exit.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/40912845_10217910470179093_881577501048963072_n_10217910470139092.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/40912845_10217910470179093_881577501048963072_n_10217910470139092.jpg" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>After the horse show, we split off to check out some different things. I wanted to see the Dept. of Natural Resources Building since we hadn’t been there all year. They had a raptor show going when I got there.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/40802757_10217910471939137_1148602326580199424_n_10217910471819134.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/40802757_10217910471939137_1148602326580199424_n_10217910471819134.jpg" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>Right behind the DNR building is the Dole Whip stand. I’ve always been intrigued by this non-dairy dessert (which a co-worker raves about every year), and this is the year I finally tried it. So good!! Tried the pineapple flavor. This may become an annual tradition. Loved it.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/40684661_10217910472379148_8190737014132310016_n_10217910472299146.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/40684661_10217910472379148_8190737014132310016_n_10217910472299146.jpg" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>On the way back to meet up with the family, I tried another new beer - Funnel Cake Beer from Coasters, complete with powdered sugar. It’s a close cousin to mini donut beer - sweet and malty. Not quite as amazing as the mini donut beer, but it’s close to the animal barn area, whereas mini donut beer is not. Good to have options in all Fair quadrants!</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/40939129_10217910473499176_3069203665744035840_n_10217910473379173.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/40939129_10217910473499176_3069203665744035840_n_10217910473379173.jpg" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, I was off on a breakfast run. (Does not photo well, especially when we are well into eating it before I remember to take the picture!) Despite the “10:45am is the new 11:00am” incident, I decided to give the Blue Moon a second try for breakfast. Glad I did, this Breakfast Combo was all yummy! Included their sausage and egg bake (surprisingly spicy sausage, good!), cheesy hash, and monkey bread. The monkey bread was a touch too done but overall, really good and would do it again.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/40641894_10217910474139192_2387006329056133120_n_10217910474099191.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/40641894_10217910474139192_2387006329056133120_n_10217910474099191.jpg" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>While the kids worked through Kidway tickets at an alarming rate, I got a chance to sneak away to a nearby place I’d been wanting to check out, the Midway Men’s Club. The rumor is that this is one of the Fair’s best-kept cheap food secrets. They weren’t kidding, check out these prices! The kitchen was buzzing with food prep and the place was crowded, but is the food any good?</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/40791780_10217910474459200_4040181881721847808_n_10217910474259195.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/40791780_10217910474459200_4040181881721847808_n_10217910474259195.jpg" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>We also sampled the chocolate soft serve from the stand right next to the Cosgrove Stage. Wasn’t expecting much, but this was surprisingly good! Very malty. First person to catch the cameo appearance in the comments wins one of these ice creams at next year’s Fair. :-)</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/40613464_10217910474699206_4850553424913104896_n_10217910474619204.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/40613464_10217910474699206_4850553424913104896_n_10217910474619204.jpg" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>Speaking of Katie, her last custom Fair shirt of the year!</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/40685675_10217910476099241_3650562330032340992_n_10217910476019239.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/40685675_10217910476099241_3650562330032340992_n_10217910476019239.jpg" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>Moving on from the Kidway, Henry took over the Cosgrove Stage and delivered a very long show for us and everyone else passing by.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/40647514_10217910476579253_3430374535180845056_n_10217910476499251.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/40647514_10217910476579253_3430374535180845056_n_10217910476499251.jpg" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>Back with the family, Henry started in on his corn dog while watching tractors and trucks prep for the afternoon rodeo.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/40613874_10217910477419274_5254854544914907136_n_10217910477179268.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/40613874_10217910477419274_5254854544914907136_n_10217910477179268.jpg" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>Others were ready to hit more of the Fair while Henry was still enthralled by the horse show, so I stayed back with him while the ladies went shopping at the Grandstand. Racing through the poles… this was really fun, kids as young as six riding really fast, big horses against the adults. The winner was about a 9 year old girl!</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/40641476_10217910478659305_5556380997353734144_n_10217910478579303.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/40641476_10217910478659305_5556380997353734144_n_10217910478579303.jpg" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>It turns out that Henry’s show stage was the perfect place to be at 2pm when the parade rolled by. Giant steer, of course.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/40661182_10217910479139317_8922984107231674368_n_10217910479059315.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/40661182_10217910479139317_8922984107231674368_n_10217910479059315.jpg" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>…and back out front of the DNR building, checking out the fish pond full of MN fish.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/40815556_10217910479699331_7550692990453284864_n_10217910479659330.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/40815556_10217910479699331_7550692990453284864_n_10217910479659330.jpg" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>Back in the DNR building looking at the fish tanks. Hello, Mr. Trout!</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/40905542_10217910479979338_3381692794572636160_n_10217910479939337.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/40905542_10217910479979338_3381692794572636160_n_10217910479939337.jpg" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>To wrap up the day we treated Henry to one more round of trampoline bungee!</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/40657843_10217910480299346_6172483262712119296_n_10217910480259345.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/40657843_10217910480299346_6172483262712119296_n_10217910480259345.jpg" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>The dairy goats are much calmer than meat goats. They are very sweet, and Henry loved petting them.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/40644300_10217910481179368_3088151390711709696_n_10217910481059365.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/40644300_10217910481179368_3088151390711709696_n_10217910481059365.jpg" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>Horse drill team - impressive coordination of 21 horses!</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/40764152_10217910481379373_7480530228612169728_n_10217910481339372.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/40764152_10217910481379373_7480530228612169728_n_10217910481339372.jpg" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>I grabbed a mini donut beer (my last one of the year!) and settled in.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/40848421_10217910481899386_4993657916989898752_n_10217910481819384.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/40848421_10217910481899386_4993657916989898752_n_10217910481819384.jpg" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>While at the Coliseum we met up with our neighbors the (partial) Lovaas family. Hi @[1062290882:2048:Matt Lovaas]!</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/40848424_10217910481979388_8369838314311647232_n_10217910481939387.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/40848424_10217910481979388_8369838314311647232_n_10217910481939387.jpg" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>I ordered some of the $2.75 cheeseburgers and kept my expectations low, but was delightfully surprised when they asked if I wanted grilled onions and pickles at no extra charge. Why yes, yes I do! After a long wait as they worked through the lunch rush, my burgers were ready. Ok, so for $2.75, this is certainly not gourmet but it is a really decent burger. It tastes a little like a White Castle burger with the onions. And it’s actually kinda nice that it’s not huge - you never want to commit too much to one item at the Fair after all. Plus, they put the money to good use in the community. So this is a win all around. Everyone enjoyed their burgers!</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/40683752_10217910482459400_5555911239600701440_n_10217910482339397.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/40683752_10217910482459400_5555911239600701440_n_10217910482339397.jpg" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>We made our annual Labor Day last day family visit to the State Fair this morning with grandma @[100003102454896:2048:Sally Richards]. Up bright and early, we were at the Fairgrounds by 8:30am. Our first stop was to see the goats. Katie particularly enjoyed this goat looking blissful.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/40651744_10217910483499426_5315968996074323968_n_10217910483019414.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/40651744_10217910483499426_5315968996074323968_n_10217910483019414.jpg" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>Katie and Sally returned with fries after shopping. Not just any fries, a bucket o’ Fresh French Fries! These are just really good straightforward french fries. I don’t always want fries at the Fair, but when I do these always hit the spot, and the booth smells amazing when I walk by.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/40694504_10217910483939437_7279984461666582528_n_10217910483859435.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/40694504_10217910483939437_7279984461666582528_n_10217910483859435.jpg" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>Group photo at the end of a long but very fun day. Three generations of family fun today!</p>

<p>And with that, I reluctantly trudged across the pedestrian bridge over Como Ave. and out the exit gate for the last time this year. Stay tuned for my annual Fair round-up post, coming soon!</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/40654360_10217910484379448_4347798464642416640_n_10217910484299446.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/40654360_10217910484379448_4347798464642416640_n_10217910484299446.jpg" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>We didn’t get a picture together but we also met up with Henry’s cousin Ada and uncle Ben today. Ada and Henry rode the puppy coaster on the Kidway.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/40624277_10217910484859460_7299347308108316672_n_10217910484779458.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/40624277_10217910484859460_7299347308108316672_n_10217910484779458.jpg" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>Next up was the horse show in the coliseum. Here they are setting up for an event we’d never seen before. The cowboys and cowgirls had to race to get their horses saddled up and raced around the track.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/40862245_10217910485419474_7120353360636542976_n_10217910485379473.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/40862245_10217910485419474_7120353360636542976_n_10217910485379473.jpg" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>We then headed towards the Kidway for rides, but Sally detoured for a Peterson’s pork chop!</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/40694599_10217910486059490_6291237927330512896_n_10217910485939487.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/40694599_10217910486059490_6291237927330512896_n_10217910485939487.jpg" alt="image" /></a></p>
