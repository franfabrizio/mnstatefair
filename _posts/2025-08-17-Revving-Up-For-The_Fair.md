We're five days out from the Fair! We have plans to make our first visit on Thursday, and to be there extra early because we have a mid-afternoon event to get to. The first day of the Fair is always special - the grass is still lush and green, the vendors aren't worn down from 12 days of hard work yet, and the crowd is just extra happy to be back at the Fair.

This year, we have another out of town visitor, my sister! She's been to the Fair before so this won't be a first timer, but it's been a long time since she's been, so still fun!

Our first visit will be a whole-family visit, so I suspect we'll spend a decent amount of time with the animals, and probably some time on the kidway/midway (unfortunately, IMO). I'll still try to hit several new foods and vendors! The current plan is to make a second trip with my sister later in the Fair, as well as a "date day" with Katie, hopefully. I will make my annual solo trip of course, and then depending on how all of that goes, we might return on Labor Day for a final visit.

To be honest, this summer has been a whirlwind, so I don't feel ready for the Fair this year, but I know once I get there, I'll be right back in my happy place. What am I looking forward to? Of course my [Can't Miss list of the new foods](https://fairlyobsessed.blog/New-Foods-Preview/). As far as new vendors, I'm pumped for Beans & Beignets and Magdalena's Chimney Cakes. And speaking of vendors, some bummer news: Nordic Waffles has left the Fair. It took years for them to introduce an item worth standing in that line for: the glorious Waffle Dog. Turns out it had a brief two-year lifespan. Oh well.

I'm hopeful for a strong free music year, but I think the Grandstand lineup is fairly weak - nothing I felt compelled to get tickets for this year. 

Outside of that, I'm just open for what I know will be the usual Fair surprises and delights! I'll be faithfully posting visit summaries as usual, and we'll just see where this year's Fair takes us!

Till Thursday,
Your Fair-Obsessed Hosta
