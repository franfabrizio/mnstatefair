Fourth trip to the Fair last night! Katie gave me tickets to see Garrison Keillor and The Minnesota Show at the Fair Grandstand for my birthday. We went a little early for some more food adventures.  
We dove right in, deep fried pickles, one of our favorite guilty pleasures at the Fair! The super crunchy outside, the sour punch inside, ranch dipping sauce... Amazing.

New food item this year, burnt ends from RC's BBQ. So-so, would skip next time.

A throwback to our St Louis days, toasted ravioli (which are really fried ravioli). We'd never had these at the Fair. It's another skip... Pouring the sauce on top like that ruins the dish because there was no crunch left.

The rare repeat food in the same Fair year! Another Poncho Dog (corn dog) for me! So good!

I couldn't stop thinking about the pretzel from Wednesdays trip, so Katie and I split a cinnamon sugar one for dessert.  Another thumbs up, though if I had to choose just one, I'd get the plain one I had Wednesday. Can't go wrong, though!

Stroll past the Midway on the way to the show.

One last detour for some more mini donut beer. Please, Lift Bridge Brewing, make this available year round!

Settled in for the show. Gorgeous Minnesota summer night.

The ultimate State Fair stereotype buster.... Listening to one of Garrison Keillor's guests singing opera! Show was great, lots of Minnesota humor and good music. We had to cut out after two hours, when he had just reached intermission! He's not really slowing down in retirement.

Classic Fair scene.

And that's a wrap! See you Sunday for the fifth and final (well, maybe...) trip for this year.
