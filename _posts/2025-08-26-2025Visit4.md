We were up in the air about going back for another visit, but Henry has only been able to get a small taste of the Fair, since school started last week. So, I felt like we should go back one more time for him. Katie opted out, so it became a boys' outing, which was also fun!

In fact, we had our earliest Fair arrival of the year yet, on the grounds by 7:30am.

The weather was perfect, the cool of the morning still in the air, and the crowds were still hours away - my favorite time to be on the Fairgrounds.

We started our morning by fueling up at Anchor Coffee. I opted for the mini donut latte while Henry went for the chai tea latte.

From there it was a proper sit-down breakfast at Hamline Church Dining Hall to start the day right.

We shared the Al's Blueberry Pancakes breakfast special, with a side of roasted potatoes.

It was a classic meal in a classic locale. There's just something about spending the morning in a communal dining hall eating a hearty breakfast surrounded by other Fair lovers. Inevitably, a conversation sparks up with your neighbors about your plans for the day and what foods you're gonna try. Just gets you in the right Fair mood!

Bellies full, we made our way back towards the animal barns. Which brought us past the corn, so of course.

Another winner! Banner year for the corn.

We hadn't seen the poultry barn yet this year so we checked that out. We were surprised to find the barn still totally full of animals even though it's the last day of the Fair. We enjoyed looking at all the beautiful breeds of chickens.

Less clear was whether they enjoyed being looked at.

At 9am we went over to Warner Coliseum to settle in for the horse speed event finals, one of our favorite shows of the Fair. We caught a couple of the events. First up was the four-in-a-line event:

and then the barrel racing event (jump, figure eight around three barrels, jump again).

After an hour of some impressive horse riding skills, we wandered back outside. We picked up a turkey to go sandwich (which just a touch of BBQ sauce to mix it up this year) and caught a fun show on the DNR stage by the Heart of the Beast puppet show folks.

Turkey-to-Go now sells exclusively the Giant version of their sandwich, but it was still no match for the two of us. It was as good as I remember it, juicy and tender and squishy-bread-delicions. The BBQ sauce was fine but completely optional.

Henry had never been up the DNS fire tower, so while we were there we went up for a quick visit.

Henry enjoyed the view of the Grandstand from the treetops.

When we came back down, there was an event over on the Dan Patch stage that looked interesting. It was Hmong MN Day at the Fair, and this year the community is celebrating 50 years in Minnesota. We saw some traditional dance, and then the Miss Hmong Minnesota finalists took the stage to show off their traditional Hmong formal wear and talk more about the cultural celebration.

When that ended Henry wanted to ride the Skyride, so we took that to the other end of the Fairgrounds.

I enjoy how the Skyride gives you both a birds' eye view and a behind the scenes view of the Fair. I always like watching the people go down the Giant Slide from the Skyride.

At the other end, we continued the trend of skyward activities by taking a spin on the Space Tower.

Here's our selfie in the sky!

If you zoom in you can see downtown Minneapolis in the distance.

While on the eastern end of the Fair I wanted to get one last new food in, the Bison Meatball Sub at Farmers Union.

We both thought this was really good! The meatballs were a mix of bison and pork, and the outsides had a great texture. The crispy fried onions also helped texturally. The brown gravy tied it all together, and the cucumbers added a bit of freshness. Overall, it's a win! A pricy one though, at $17.

After that it was time to head back west to the Midway so that Henry could get in a few more rides this year. One of them was this abomination.

He loved it though!

After a few more rides, I took Henry to Greater Tater. We really didn't need the food, but I wanted him to see what an individual with Down syndrome had accomplished, and lucky for us, David was there this time!

[![image](/assets/2025/2025Visit4/greatertater.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025Visit4/greatertater.jpg)

We got to speak with him briefly, and I introduced Henry and told how excited we were that they were having such a great year and that I wanted to make sure Henry saw what he had accomplished so that he could dream big for his own future. David was very happy to meet us and it was really fun to meet him!

They've had such a good fair that they were down to their last tater keg flavor, the cheese bomb.

Once again with the Top the Tater topping. These were cheesy and delicious and lived up to their "bomb" name!

From there, it was time to head out. We'd been there six hours and the crowds were starting to fill in. Henry wanted one last taste of Sweet Martha's, so we got a bucket to go.

We'll be munching on those for a few days! The server put _one and a half cookie sheets_ worth of cookies in that bucket! This photo was taken after we'd eaten a dozen or so.

With that, we headed out to the car and said goodbye to the Fair for 2025. We covered a lot of ground over four visits, hosted Dana for the Fair, Katie and I got our date day, and we got Henry there twice despite the start of school. That's a successful Fair year! As always, look for my wrap-up and awards post in the near future. I hope all the locals got to make lots of their own Fair memories this year and that our far-away readers got to live the MN State Fair vicariously through our eyes once again!
