Except for two bites of a corn dog, I did the entire Fair visit yesterday without eating fried food!  I could have eaten even healthier, I still have to get my annual peach from the produce exchange, and this year they added watermelon kombucha which I want to try.  Also, anyone who wants that carpe diem fish shaped sundae, I forgot to mention it's only there the first half of the Fair, because then the midtown global market both switches over to Hot Indian. So hurry!
