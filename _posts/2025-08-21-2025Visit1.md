Well folks, it's here! 2025 Fair visit #1 is in the books.

The wheels were rolling by 7am as we headed Fairward, hopefully early enough to get a decent parking spot in the Como lot - we needed to head out mid-afternoon, and having the car there would save us a lot of time. We were in the Fair neighborhood by 7:20am, but even then we were in pretty deep traffic, the first sign that maybe this was going to be an unusually busy opening day. A little after 8, we finally got into the parking lot and got a spot way in the back - phew.

Today's visit was with Katie, Henry (had to go right away because his school starts Monday, how un-Minnesotan is that?!), and my sister Dana in from out of town.

None of us had breakfast so we immediately beelined for the most obvious breakfast choice - the pork chop on a stick.

It was pretty good, but it's clear that they were still getting their operation dialed in for the year. We'll be back.

After hanging out with our esteemed senior senator from Minnesota, Amy Klobuchar, as one does...

[![image](/assets/2025/2025-08-21-2025Visit1/PXL_20250821_134406773.MP.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025-08-21-2025Visit1/PXL_20250821_134406773.MP.jpg)

...we headed over towards the animal barns. On the way we passed one of the new vendors, Magdalene's, the hungarian rotisserie pastry place. Despite the fact that we're still basically at 8am, I decided to start the new food tasting and got their ice cream "cone", where the cone is the rotisserie pastry.

[![image](/assets/2025/2025-08-21-2025Visit1/PXL_20250821_135139330.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025-08-21-2025Visit1/PXL_20250821_135139330.jpg)

It was vanilla ice cream with an oreo coating (looks like they're going to rotate out different flavors and toppings), and the inside of the cone is coated in nutella. I liked the pastry a lot, it is denser than normal pastry so it had a nice chew and held up well, and the sugar coating and nutella were nice. The problem with this is that you have to get through a whole lot of perfectly serviceable but nothing special ice cream to get to it, and in the process getting quite messy. I kinda want this in some other form than a cone - maybe a sandwich? Maybe the rotisserie approach means it has to be a cone, I dunno. So, it was good, but not going to be a repeat item.

Normally, it would be the sheep and their haircuts that kept Henry's attention, but this year it seemed to be the cows instead.

We also visited the horses while we were over there. Dana enjoyed the barns because she's not used to being this close to big animals!

[![image](/assets/2025/2025-08-21-2025Visit1/PXL_20250821_142529528.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025-08-21-2025Visit1/PXL_20250821_142529528.jpg)

The Miracle of Birth was just getting started, so there were relatively few babies so far, just a couple of sheep, one goat, and some adorable ducklings.

[![image](/assets/2025/2025-08-21-2025Visit1/PXL_20250821_144306116.MP.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025-08-21-2025Visit1/PXL_20250821_144306116.MP.jpg)

While browsing the animal barns, we picked up some Fresh French Fries at Henry's request. The fry folks needed no time to get dialed in, these were excellent!

[![image](/assets/2025/2025-08-21-2025Visit1/PXL_20250821_144801412.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025-08-21-2025Visit1/PXL_20250821_144801412.jpg)

After the animals we made our way over to the West End so Dana could catch the Minnesota-History-on-a-Schtick performance. While they did that, I hit the Blue Barn for their new Sweet Squeakers. Deep lines already! Oof. These are cheese curds with funnel cake batter, fresh lemon cream, and berry sauce.

[![image](/assets/2025/2025-08-21-2025Visit1/PXL_20250821_152707372.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025-08-21-2025Visit1/PXL_20250821_152707372.jpg)

It's a little hard to evaluate these. They certainly look gorgeous. If I'm just considering them as a sweet dessert, it was really good, especially the lemon cream. Thing is, if I didn't know these were cheese curds, I might have had no idea I was eating cheese. It just didn't add anything to the dish. And I'm certainly not passing up traditional cheese curds for these, so do they even need the cheese? So, while I like the concept, I think maybe they're solving a problem that doesn't exist?

Henry was pumped for the rides so we made a quick detour to the Midway. After going on two very spinny rides with him, I opted out on the third and he had a blast by himself.

[![image](/assets/2025/2025-08-21-2025Visit1/PXL_20250821_162045412.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025-08-21-2025Visit1/PXL_20250821_162045412.jpg)

Then Katie, who had stayed back in the West End to do a little shopping, arrived like a fairy godmother of deep fried pickles. These were probably the food highlight of the day - done PERFECTLY. Well, it is called Perfect Pickle, I suppose.

[![image](/assets/2025/2025-08-21-2025Visit1/PXL_20250821_160155362~2.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025-08-21-2025Visit1/PXL_20250821_160155362~2.jpg)

From there it was a Skyride trip over to the east side of the Fair, where we picked up a couple of lunch items at the Gass Station Grille.

[![image](/assets/2025/2025-08-21-2025Visit1/PXL_20250821_163801733.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025-08-21-2025Visit1/PXL_20250821_163801733.jpg)

First up was the Smasadilla, a smashburger-quesadilla love child.

[![image](/assets/2025/2025-08-21-2025Visit1/PXL_20250821_170100987.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025-08-21-2025Visit1/PXL_20250821_170100987.jpg)

First of all, it's basically a smashataco, not a smashadilla - the tortilla was grilled, but I'm not sure "open-faced quesadilla" is a thing. And it wasn't even great as a taco - the smashburger is fairly resistant to being folded in half, so this got messy quick. Putting that aside, it was fine. Nothing to write home about, but you could do worse. The pickles were probably the highlight for me. It was a bit small for $12, too. Meh.

We also tried their corn dog bites.

[![image](/assets/2025/2025-08-21-2025Visit1/PXL_20250821_170808349.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025-08-21-2025Visit1/PXL_20250821_170808349.jpg)

I was expecting something like little corn dog nuggets, but no, they're actually miniature corn dogs, stick and all. Kinda cute. If you are the type of person who likes the outside of the corn dog more than the inside, you might just like these.

Katie went on a heroic mission to try to get food items at the Farmer's Union, but they also were having First Day Problems. They ran out of the apple version of the Patisserie 46 treat, and then the bison meatball sub was taking too long, so she only came away with two maple nitro cold brews for me and Dana (which were delicious, and this is a terrible picture).

[![image](/assets/2025/2025-08-21-2025Visit1/PXL_20250821_172052640.MP.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025-08-21-2025Visit1/PXL_20250821_172052640.MP.jpg)

By this time it was getting quite humid so Katie and Henry found a quiet, shady spot over by the Admin building to take a rest while Dana and I checked out the Ag building - which was super crowded. The seed art line was about 150 people deep and all the way across the central atrium. Long line for the cider pop treats too. These first-day crowds are starting to be a drag!

We just went into the seed competition area and viewed the crop art from a distance. Which the volunteer REALLY didn't like - she did not appreciate that we (and many others) found a loophole and kept trying to insist that we needed to move along to keep the seed competition display accessible. Can we be real? NO ONE is trying to get a closer look at the 300 different soybean collections on display, lady! Anywayyyyy.... since we were at a distance, I don't have great pictures, and will do another pass later in the Fair.

We also tried to see the vegetable collections, but they were closed off due to judging. So we watched the judges do their thing instead.

Dana and I had better luck in the bee wing, where we found the queen in this hive (hint: look for a colored dot and a bee getting doted on by a whole bunch of worker bees).

[![image](/assets/2025/2025-08-21-2025Visit1/PXL_20250821_174238916.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025-08-21-2025Visit1/PXL_20250821_174238916.jpg)

Also, the honey-based food categories are not displayed in the Creative Activities building with the rest of the categories, they are displayed here, which means I usually overlook them. The honey breads looked amazing.

[![image](/assets/2025/2025-08-21-2025Visit1/PXL_20250821_174134314.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025-08-21-2025Visit1/PXL_20250821_174134314.jpg)

And in all my fairgoing years I don't think I have ever been to the live beekeeper demonstration, which was cool to see.

[![image](/assets/2025/2025-08-21-2025Visit1/PXL_20250821_174625935.MP.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025-08-21-2025Visit1/PXL_20250821_174625935.MP.jpg)

While in the Ag building we wandered through the Christmas tree displays. There's something about going through this section every year when it's summer outside that just tickles me! Here's one of our favorite traditionally decorated trees.

[![image](/assets/2025/2025-08-21-2025Visit1/PXL_20250821_173817446.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025-08-21-2025Visit1/PXL_20250821_173817446.jpg)

From here we went to meet up with the others, but I detoured to the Ball Park Cafe for my first mini donut beer of the Fair! Hello, old friend...

[![image](/assets/2025/2025-08-21-2025Visit1/PXL_20250821_175154944.MP.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025-08-21-2025Visit1/PXL_20250821_175154944.MP.jpg)

As I mentioned, it felt all day like this was a busier opening day than usual (normally the slowest day of the Fair), and it certainly felt crowded. I'm curious to see the attendance number tomorrow and whether it's an all-time record.

[![image](/assets/2025/2025-08-21-2025Visit1/PXL_20250821_175409659.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025-08-21-2025Visit1/PXL_20250821_175409659.jpg)

It was getting really unpleasantly hot and muggy so Katie and Henry wisely took the Skyride back so that we could catch the draft horse show.

[![image](/assets/2025/2025-08-21-2025Visit1/PXL_20250821_180621010.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025-08-21-2025Visit1/PXL_20250821_180621010.jpg)

Dana and I hoofed it so we could pit stop at Sweet Martha's for a bucket, Henry's final food request for the day.

[![image](/assets/2025/2025-08-21-2025Visit1/PXL_20250821_181145114.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025-08-21-2025Visit1/PXL_20250821_181145114.jpg)

It was nice to take a break in the Coliseum. The A/C upgrades the Fair has been touting were evident in the concourse, but unfortunately not in the arena itself - still gets quite warm in there! But the show was fun. The key to a good draft team is synchronization of the horses' legs, so we tried to guess who the winners would be. We were 1 for 2 in getting it right.

[![image](/assets/2025/2025-08-21-2025Visit1/PXL_20250821_182316836.jpg)](/assets/2025/2025-08-21-2025Visit1/PXL_20250821_182316836.jpg)

At this point, we were all, as Henry would say, "poofed". And we still had somewhere to be later that afternoon, so we decided to head out. All told it was about a six hour trip to the Fair, short by our standards, but the weather and crowds were more than we were expecting, and we were all ready to call it a day, knowing there would be more trips back soon. So, a somewhat low-key but successful first day. No new food home runs, but several well-executed Fair classics went down the hatch.

The weather looks AMAZING into the weekend and next week, so I expect big crowds but also some really pleasant days at the Fair coming up!
