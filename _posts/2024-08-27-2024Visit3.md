# My Annual Solo Visit

After morning meetings, I was able to cut out of work and head over to the Fairgrounds for my annual solo visit. I covered a lot of ground (literally - 23,000 steps!) in about six hours, exploring just about every corner of the Fair.

To give the day some structure I decided to walk the History Walking Tour, which takes you on a loop around the entire grounds. From there, I looked at foods and drinks I was pretty sure the rest of the family would not be interested in as some of my targets for the day, and off I went!

First food stop was for RC BBQ's Sweet Heat Bacon Crunch. 

[![image](/assets/2024-08-27/sweetheat.jpg)](/assets/2024-08-27/sweetheat.jpg)

This was a _fantastic_ start to the day! This dish involves smoked slab bacon in BBQ sauce and topped with a hot honey and chili crunch and green onions, served on a bed of rice. I'm currently having a thing for chili crunch so I was really interested in trying this after it got some good reviews last week. I loved everything about this - the crunch was flavorful but not overpowerfully spicy, the slab bacon was definitely smoky and tender, not overdone. The rice turned out to be a perfect complement to the heat of the dish. I was scraping the bowl on this one. My only complaint is the price - at $13, this is probably $4 too expensive given the portion size. I expect to pay inflated prices at the Fair and even moreso for new foods, but that was excessive. If they take a few bucks off the price I think they could have a mainstay item on their menu.

After that I did a loop of the West End before starting the walking route. I came across this oddity of a pop-up performance in the West End Market:

This is apparently something called The State Fair Fitness Fanatics Comedy Show. It was... something. I watched for about 5 minutes but found it too awkward to keep watching. Points for trying though!

Next I wandered through the pig barn, and my timing was good because there was judging going on. This pig won its class. Apparently the judge liked her skeleton, the distance off the ground, and the way it used its hind legs.

After petting some cows I was hungry again, and the next food stop was for the Buffalo Chicken Cheese Curd Tacos. This involves fried buffalo-flavored cheese curds and chicken topped with blue cheese slaw and buffalo sauce in a fried flour shell. And here I made a rookie mistake - I forgot to take a photo! I did take a photo of the marquee while waiting in line.

[![image](/assets/2024-08-27/curds.jpg)](/assets/2024-08-27/curds.jpg)

I had a good reason for being distracted, though. Readers might remember last year's out of state visitor Chris. When this year's new foods list came out, Chris declared that he was most excited about this one, so I suggested I live stream the tasting. Well, we did! Chris was at the US Open in NYC, no less!

Here's the food screenshot from the Fair's new foods webpage:

[![image](/assets/2024-08-27/buffalotacos.jpg)](/assets/2024-08-27/buffalotacos.jpg)

Unfortunately, the food itself didn't quite live up to the hype. It wasn't terrible by any means - the buffalo flavor was legit and the crispy flour shell was also a highlight. The major miss was the slaw - I couldn't taste any blue cheese flavor at all, and overall the slaw felt barely there. More minor quibbles included that the cheese curd and chicken coating felt soggy, maybe from the buffalo sauce, and the ratio of cheese to chicken felt a little off - too much cheese, not enough chicken. All in all, I gave these a B-.

After my livestream with Chris, I wandered through the Miracle of Life. Not that many cute babies today, but out back is one of my favorite Fair secret corners, the Future Farmers of America competition gardens. I like to check these out and get ideas for our landscaping. This year's theme was designing garden's for the changing climate. Here's the winning garden, made by the Dassel-Cokato chapter (factoid: not far from the world's largest ball of twine!) I got several ideas for plants to add at our house.

From there I wandered over to the Creative Activities Building. The founder of T-Rex Cookies was presenting in the demonstration kitchen.

[![image](/assets/2024-08-27/trex.jpg)](/assets/2024-08-27/trex.jpg)

I learned that the reason T-Rex cookies are so big is because she had really bad tennis elbow at the time she was starting the business and making the cookies big was less painful, and they turned out to be a huge hit. I also learned that their sea salt caramel chocolate chip cookie won a best cookie in the country award! And finally and most interesting, she mentioned that the company was pivoting away from grocery store distribution to things like stadiums and airports because the margins in grocery stores are tiny. She said that T-Rex Cookies were in Target for four years, and in that time T-Rex made $4,000 from that deal!

Next up, one of the things I really look forward to each year, the kids' art! It seemed like a bit of a quiet year, but there were still several amazing pieces. Here are a few that I liked.

11th grade!

5th grade!

Next up on the food scene was the Que Viet Giant Egg Roll on a Stick. This is not a new food, but one I hadn't had for many years, and remembered fondly. 

[![image](/assets/2024-08-27/eggroll.jpg)](/assets/2024-08-27/eggroll.jpg)

Well, things have changed, and not in a good way. First off, the shell of this thing was SUPER crunchy. Too crunchy, had to fight through it. Once I did things did not improve - the filling was basically solid pork. It was like eating a pork sausage. It wasn't terrible as pork sausage goes, but it wasn't an eggroll. There was no obvious cabbage, and what little veggies it had were sort of completely encased in the pork. As I was trying this, I heard someone at the next table comment that it seemed more "pork-y" this year, so maybe we just got a bad batch. Whatever the reason, it was a terrible disappointment.

I popped over to the Hamline Dining Hall to attempt to purge the disappointment with a Cinnamon Affogato.

[![image](/assets/2024-08-27/affogato.jpg)](/assets/2024-08-27/affogato.jpg)

This was much better. The ice cream was definitely cinnamon-y and I appreciated the mini biscotti as well. If I have a minor nitpick it's that I wish it had come in a smaller, taller cup - at the end, I sort of felt like I was scooping up espresso from a dog bowl!

I went into the Fine Arts building next. Here are a few of my favorite pieces.

[![image](/assets/2024-08-27/dog.jpg)](/assets/2024-08-27/dog.jpg)

[![image](/assets/2024-08-27/vacuum.jpg)](/assets/2024-08-27/vacuum.jpg)

I'm always a sucker for intricate details...

[![image](/assets/2024-08-27/map.jpg)](/assets/2024-08-27/map.jpg)

I doubled back to the 4-H Building so that I could catch their theater performance. I haven't seen it in several years and it's always fun to see what the kids in the 4-H summer camp have come up with - they only have 8 days to prepare before the run of shows at the Fair starts! This year's performance was called Wonder Full, a musical about a travel agency and how the trips it sends its clients on have changed their lives.

[![image](/assets/2024-08-27/4h.jpg)](/assets/2024-08-27/4h.jpg)

As I made my way north, I stopped at Giggle's to do my annual force-myself-to-try-one-new-beer-even-though-I'll-hate-it. This year, I settled on the Sweet Clementine beer.

[![image](/assets/2024-08-27/beer.jpg)](/assets/2024-08-27/beer.jpg)

To my great surprise, I did not in fact hate this, I actually enjoyed it a lot! It didn't feel gimmicky (gummy candy aside), but did feel novel enough to be a Fair drink. It was refreshing and tasted enough like clementines that a nearby bee was quite persistent in wanting to get into the beer.

After a loop through shopping destinations up north (scored a nice Flyers hat for cheap!) and the Pet Pavillion (I'll spare you the photo of pet surgery), I headed back down towards the Ag building. Along the way, I stopped at new vendor Chan's Eatery for some boba tea.

[![image](/assets/2024-08-27/boba.jpg)](/assets/2024-08-27/boba.jpg)

As I suspected, this works quite well at the Fair. I had the Thai Milk Tea with Tapioca Boba, which is pretty classic, but they also had lots of fruity combos. I'm happy to have some boba at the Fair, especially up north which is a bit of a food and drink desert. I didn't try their Korean corn dogs, but they looked ridiculous, and you could get them coated in hot Cheetos dust.

At the Ag building I checked out the SEED ART!!

[![image](/assets/2024-08-27/line.jpg)](/assets/2024-08-27/line.jpg)

Yes the line was very long and moving slowly. The Fair advertised better traffic flow at the seed art this year, but I noticed no improvement. Oh well, still worth it! Here are a few of my faves. One thing I never appreciated before is how some of the artists are so creative showing what seeds they used.

I remember this picture from National Geographic from when I was a kid!

This being an election year, especially with Governor Walz on the ticket, there were plenty of political ones.

[![image](/assets/2024-08-27/murder.jpg)](/assets/2024-08-27/murder.jpg)

Yep, in our hyper-politicized environment, even depicting the new state flag is political.

[![image](/assets/2024-08-27/flag.jpg)](/assets/2024-08-27/flag.jpg)

After the long and slow line of the seed art, I was pretty hot. Luckily, I was in the right spot and grabbed a cider freeze, one of the Fair's truly simple pleasures.

[![image](/assets/2024-08-27/freeze.jpg)](/assets/2024-08-27/freeze.jpg)

It was time to start heading out. I got a mini donut beer for the trek.

[![image](/assets/2024-08-27/donutbeer.jpg)](/assets/2024-08-27/donutbeer.jpg)

I came across KSTP's news broadcast doing the weather live from the Fair.

[![image](/assets/2024-08-27/weather.jpg)](/assets/2024-08-27/weather.jpg)

One last lap around the West End. I was wondering if the glass blowers are still there, and sure enough, they are and they were doing a demo.

[![image](/assets/2024-08-27/glass.jpg)](/assets/2024-08-27/glass.jpg)

Ending where I began, we closed out with a much better pop-up performance in the West End market, this time flamenco dancing.

[![image](/assets/2024-08-27/flamenco.jpg)](/assets/2024-08-27/flamenco.jpg)

And with that my 2024 walking tour card was full and my solo visit was done! I enjoy this trip every year, getting to go at my own pace and wander into some of the more random and less-traveled corners of the Fair. We'll be back probably two more times this year - one date day and probably one more family day. Until then, have fun at the Fair!

[![image](/assets/2024-08-27/tour.jpg)](/assets/2024-08-27/tour.jpg)



















Before I get to our day 2 visit, there were a few things I didn't cover in my Day 1 post because I wasn't able to get the photos from Katie's phone in time. So, here are a few more highlights!

Of course we had the roasted corn. I have this same picture so many times, so to mix it up I went for an artsy look.

[![image](/assets/2024-08-22/artsycorn.jpg)](/assets/2024-08-22/artsycorn.jpg)

We also checked out the giant veggies. The prize winning pumpkin was over 1800 lbs. this year!

[![image](/assets/2024-08-22/giantpumpkins.jpg)](/assets/2024-08-22/giantpumpkins.jpg)

We also did some learnin'! Here we are all taking turns learning how to use a weaving loom.

[![image](/assets/2024-08-22/weaving.jpg)](/assets/2024-08-22/weaving.jpg)

Ok, now we're all caught up!

# On to Day 2!

We turned right back around and went to the Fair again on Friday. Since we're hosting our out-of-state friends Larry, Ilyse and Jake, I didn't get a chance to blog our visit until now. It was fairly short and kid-centered, so not too much to report, but there were a few highlights!

After the parking debacle of the day before, I wasn't about to risk a drive directly to the Fair, and I also thought it'd be nice to let our guests sleep in a bit on their vacation, so we opted for the paid Park And Ride from Bloomington, which it worked out just fine. Comfy busses that came without much wait for $6 total per person. Wayyy less stressful than our day 1  visit!

[![image](/assets/2024-08-23/bus.jpg)](/assets/2024-08-23/bus.jpg)

The ride in was full of anticipation and excitement. Upon arrival our littlest friend was a bit overwhelmed at all of the sights and sounds. So much to do and see he couldn't process it all and decide what he wanted to do first. I get it, buddy! Luckily, dad came to the rescue with a big win on the Midway to score a dino backpack (pictured with the pretzel later in this post).

[![image](/assets/2024-08-23/midway.jpg)](/assets/2024-08-23/midway.jpg)

That certainly helped improve the mood, as did a big honkin bucket of Fresh French Fries...

[![image](/assets/2024-08-23/fries.jpg)](/assets/2024-08-23/fries.jpg)

...and some deep-fried pickles.

[![image](/assets/2024-08-23/pickles.jpg)](/assets/2024-08-23/pickles.jpg)

Two Fair food classics that need no further explanation.

While wandering down in the area, Ilyse was intrigued by Hotdish-on-a-Stick. Hotdish is quintessential Minnesota, so she was encouraged to try it.

[![image](/assets/2024-08-23/hotdish.jpg)](/assets/2024-08-23/hotdish.jpg)

Meatball-tater tot-meatball-tater tot-meatball, battered and deep fried, with cream of mushroom dipping sauce. Big hit for the native Long Islander! 

Food in our bellies, we headed towards the animal barns. Or at least, we thought we would - until our littlest friend encountered the smell of the barns and stopped in his tracks. A little too much farm fragrance for him, he nope'd out of the barns, so we executed Plan B - project Pretzel Factory!

[![image](/assets/2024-08-23/pretzel.jpg)](/assets/2024-08-23/pretzel.jpg)

Although the pretzel certainly did the trick for him, for me it was definitely blah. I was hopeful that the Pretzel Factory might fill the void left when the Pretzel Haus stopped selling regular pretzels, but this one advertized as a true Bavarian pretzel wasn't even close to as good. Sigh.

We had better luck with an old favorite, Turkey to Go. 

[![image](/assets/2024-08-23/ttg.jpg)](/assets/2024-08-23/ttg.jpg)

Our first-timers really appreciated the simplicity of this sandwich, which lets the turkey and marinade shine.

Next up we hit the Kidway for some serious ride riding! 

[![image](/assets/2024-08-23/ride.jpg)](/assets/2024-08-23/ride.jpg)

The Kidway/Midway continues to be the most overpriced and underwhelming part of the Fair for me, but the kids love it and as a parent you gotta just roll with it!

While we were tearin' up the Kidway, Katie made a side trip to Baba's. 

[![image](/assets/2024-08-23/babas.jpg)](/assets/2024-08-23/babas.jpg)

If you haven't been to Baba's at the Fair yet, you're missing out. Their hummus bowls are creative and delicious. Here's this year's new creation, the Ba'Bacon Sour Cream + Onion Hummus Bowl. 

[![image](/assets/2024-08-23/babasbowl.jpg)](/assets/2024-08-23/babasbowl.jpg)

Delicious!! Tater tots and carmelized onions worked great in this, and the warm pita pillows are one of my most favorite things to eat at the Fair. 

From there it was time for the Monster Shop Bump'n breakdancing show on the Family Fair stage. This was definitely a highlight of the day!

[![image](/assets/2024-08-23/monstershop.jpg)](/assets/2024-08-23/monstershop.jpg)

The breakdancing was legit, and at the end of the show, they invited the kids up on stage to show off their moves.

[![image](/assets/2024-08-23/monstershop2.jpg)](/assets/2024-08-23/monstershop2.jpg)

That's Henry towering over all the other kids having the time of his life dancing away. Jake's chilling in the back of the pack here.

The show ended just before the parade started, putting us in perfect position. We grabbed a seat on the curb and fueled up with some Bridge N Barrel root beer.

[![image](/assets/2024-08-23/rootbeer.jpg)](/assets/2024-08-23/rootbeer.jpg)

The parade is fun at the Fair, short and sweet, 20 minutes or so, but packed with marching bands and typical parade oddities. 

[![image](/assets/2024-08-23/parade.jpg)](/assets/2024-08-23/parade.jpg)

The kids were starting to wear down so we slowly made our way back towards the transportation center. That conveniently put us within striking distance of Mouth Trap.

[![image](/assets/2024-08-23/curds.jpg)](/assets/2024-08-23/curds.jpg)

This was the east coasters' first encounter with cheese curds, and they gave high marks.

And speaking of firsts, of course no first-time visit to the Fair is complete without a bucket of Sweet Martha's. Our visitors enjoyed these cookies a lot, but were even more amazed to learn that Sweet Martha's rakes in $4.5M in just 12 days. 

[![image](/assets/2024-08-23/marthas.jpg)](/assets/2024-08-23/marthas.jpg)

After the cookies our day ended with a bus ride back to Bloomington. First visits are so hard to plan, especially with little ones in tow. There's soooo much to see and do that you can't possibly get to more than a tiny fraction of it. This visit happened to center on food and rides. We were there hours and yet, except for a brief stop in the Coliseum to see cow judging, we didn't set foot in any of the permanent buildings - no Ag, Eco, Creative Arts, 4-H, Fine Arts, Dairy, the barns, DNR... and no Int'l Bazaar, North End, West End, Giant Slide, Farm Hands, Singalong, Lumberjacks, Stunt Dogs, Butterfly House, free concerts, Skyride, Space Tower, etc...etc...etc... it's just nearly impossible to get more than a brief taste of the Fair in one day with kids. So a lot was left on the table, but we hope that what they did get to experience will leave them wanting to come back again!

We forgot to take a group photo at the Fair, so here's one from mini golf the next day. 

[![image](/assets/2024-08-23/group.jpg)](/assets/2024-08-23/group.jpg)

The Fabrizios are still trying to game plan our next visit - maybe an adult visit mid-week. Almost certainly another family visit will happen at some point. Stay tuned!
