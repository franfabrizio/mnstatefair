Around this time of year I start to get the questions from friends and colleagues - "What should I do at the Fair this year?" My first response is always a question back at them: "What kind of Fair visit are you looking for?" There are so many ways to do the Fair, and it helps to have a general framework for what you're after. As Katie likes to say, you wouldn't show up to Disney World on a whim and just see where the day takes you! The Fair also requires some advance thought to maximize your chances of a good time.

Here are the different Fair visits I think about!

## The Family Visit

This is the standard "We've got kids in tow and want to hit the highlights and get out of there before the meltdowns begin" visit to the Fair. Generally works best earlier in the day, even better if you can go early enough to drive straight there and park so you have an faster getaway (do not attempt after 9am). This trip usually includes a spin through a couple of animal barns, a trip down the Giant Slide, a lap around the Kidway, a pass through Little Farm Hands. If your crew is holding up, maybe catch a magician on the Family Fair Stage, visit the Butterfly House, or go look at the giant vegetables and the butter princesses on the way back to the car. You're snacking along the way of course! Gotta have those corn dogs and warm cookies.

## The Foodie Visit

You're gameplanning for months and mapping out the most efficient route to hit all the foods you want to try. This type of visit requires some serious prep work and some pro-level logistics on the ground if you're going to get to everything. This works best in groups to share the food and split up the food retrieval duties. I may even live with someone who brings their own knife to make the food sharing easier... This is an endurance test that works best if you can spend a long day at the Fair to cover all of the different meals throughout the day and fill the time between eating walking off calories and exploring.

## The Adult Visit

This is about hanging out and trying some adult beverages while people-watching from a patio table or catching one of the free concerts. This one doesn't require as much planning - pick a few new drinks you want to try, maybe check the concert schedule, go have fun with friends. Can work any time of day but I find it's best in the evening when it's a bit cooler and the families have headed out for the day.

## The Animal Visit

This is where you're going to take a deep dive in the animal section of the fair. This is for all of those who are happy watching the rodeo, catching the llama costume contest, or chatting up the farmers. You might spend an hour perusing poultry or second-guessing the sheep judge. This one can be surprisingly tricky to plan, because there are "good" days and "bad" days for animal activities. Avoid the load-in / load-out days (when the 4H and FFA crews are swapping in/out of the barns) and make sure the horse show has some events that you want to see on the day you'll be there. The last day of the Fair is also not a good time for this, many animals are gone.

## The Music and Entertainment Visit

You can spend an entire day at the Fair doing nothing but this if you want, and I think the free live entertainment is still one of the most underappreciated aspects of the Fair. Obviously if it's a Grandstand concert you're after you'll need to go on whatever day you have tickets for, but otherwise, I actually recommend not overplanning this one too much. Maybe pick one or two of the free shows you want to check out, and otherwise just wander and see what's happening. You'll probably never _plan_ to go see that Rumba band playing the International Stage, but it just might end up being your new favorite thing and it's fun to just wander and see just how much talent there is at the Fair.

## The Arts and Crafts Visit

This is when you're going to spend most of your time over on the Eastern side of the Fair in the permanent buildings, checking out all of the judged Fair contests. I'm talking about everything from cooking and baking to handmade crafts and agriculture (veggie collections, seed art, flower shows) to the fine art and 4-H exhibitions. It takes many hours to do this thoroughly and it's really hard to do a casual pass through, you just miss too much, so it's nice to make a focused visit if this is your jam (or you entered your jam in the competition...)

## The Lifelong Learner Visit

One of my favorite types of Fair visits, this is when you just go to the Fair with an open mind ready to learn, the more random the better. Some of my best Fair memories came on solo trips where I was really able to just wander and explore the less-trodden corners of the Fair. I still remember my visits to the Minnesota Newspaper Museum and the Experimenta Aircraft Association's trailer with flight simulators. I try to spend a good hour in the Eco Building every year. There've been some really cool exhibits in the North End Event Center the past few years, and the History & Heritage Center in the West End is great, including their self-guided walking tour.

## The Rides Visit

My least favorite visit. The Midway and Kidway are both outrageously overpriced and nothing will kill the Fair spirit faster than spending $6 in tickets for a 90 second walk through a lame funhouse. It's sometimes unavoidable with kids, but instead of the midway rides, old fashioned fun like the Skyride gondolas, Ye Olde Mill or the Space Tower are all more in the Fair spirit.

## The "It's Tradition" Visit

Finally, this is the trip for the Minnesota native who grew up going to the Fair and goes once a year with their top 5 list of things they do every time. You know, the classic get a corn dog, walk through Machinery Hill, get the roasted corn, see the baby animals, get your cookies, grab a free yard stick and head home.

## That's a Wrap!

Of course, just because your visit has a theme doesn't mean you have to be rigid about it. You're at the Fair, spontaneity is the name of the game! But it definitely helps to have a general game plan heading in, otherwise it can get overwhelming and unfun very fast.

What type of Fair visitor are you? Which ones did I miss?
