Day 2 was as epic as day 1! Still camping here so the full posts will come tomorrow once we are home. For now, day 2 food notes. Not a ton of new foods tried today but some new and some new to us ...

Cream Cheese Everything Ba-Sant at French Meadow. Basically an everything bagel mashed together with a cream cheese croissant. If you love everything bagels like I do you'll love this. The everything seasoning is robust! 

Brim vanilla cold press. Cold press was fine. Very light vanilla flavor. Get the maple nitro cold press from Farmers Union instead.

Grandstand mini donuts -we've been devoted tom thumb fans but I have to say these seemed a half notch above. A little bigger, a little fresher. Might be a convert!

Korean tacos at Blue Moon. I liked these! Pretty substantial, flavorful meat. I thought not too spicy, Katie thought a little too spicy. We also got the mini Chile dogs there again, a favorite from last year that were as good as I remembered.

Pineapple Sour Beergarita at the Hangar. The beer itself is perfectly fine bordering on pretty good if you like sour beers. The salted rim was unnecessary and overpowering, so get it no salt if you're getting it. 

Apple crisp ice cream from Granny's. The portion size is small, but it is fantastically good ice cream! Great apple crisp flavor and topping throughout. We really enjoyed this. 

That's all for now! Full posts about our camping visit to the Fair later this weekend.
